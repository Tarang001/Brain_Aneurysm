###Intracranial Aneurysm Detection

Intracranial aneurysms affect nearly 3% of the global population, and tragically, up to 50% are only discovered after rupture, often leading to severe illness or death. Each year, these ruptures cause approximately 500,000 deaths worldwide, with nearly half of the victims being under the age of 50.

This project was developed as part of the RSNA Brain Aneurysm Detection Challenge, organized in collaboration with:

Radiological Society of North America (RSNA)

American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR)

Society of Neurointerventional Surgery (SNIS)

European Society of Neuroradiology (ESNR)

##🔍 Objective

The goal is to build machine learning models capable of detecting and precisely localizing intracranial aneurysms across different brain imaging modalities, including:

CTA (Computed Tomography Angiography)

MRA (Magnetic Resonance Angiography)

T1 post-contrast MRI

T2-weighted MRI

The dataset introduces real clinical variability from different institutions, scanners, and imaging protocols — challenging models to generalize effectively in diverse real-world scenarios.

##🚑 Why It Matters

An accurate and automated detection system can:

Save lives by enabling earlier diagnosis and intervention.

Assist radiologists by reducing workload and improving diagnostic efficiency.

Standardize care across institutions with varying imaging setups.

##📌 Contributions

Preprocessing pipelines for multi-modality brain imaging.

Deep learning model architectures for aneurysm detection and localization.

Training strategies for handling heterogeneous datasets.

Evaluation metrics and visualization tools.
